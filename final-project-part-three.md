# The final data story

### <a href="https://skelothan.github.io/password-strength-website/">Final Project Link</a>

# Changes made since Part II
* Broke up much of the story segments for the weak passwords into segments, positioned horizontally.
 * This is to both make the paragraphs shorter and to establish the pattern of "scroll right to keep reading this part" a bit earlier.
* Revised a lot of the text to be more clear.
 * In particular, the call to action has been clarified to explain why and how to use passphrases and password managers.
 * Also, some history and other resources have been added.
* Added an infographic explaining how passwords are stored on a website.


## The audience

Overall, I decided to focus on the general public as my audience. I originally thought I would be doing web application developers, but it ended up being the other way around. There are a few main reasons for this:

1. There are a lot more people who use websites than make them.
1. I found the call to action of "use a passphrase and a password manager" stronger. That call is aimed at a general audience, so the rest of the story grew around it.
1. A lot of password forms are from old legacy systems that can't be easily upgraded or replaced. In that case, the advice to users to use as strong a password as possible is much more useful


## Final design decisions

I originally wanted to use more charts here and to sprinkle them in with the rest of the story. Over the course of development and from feedback on the project, I found that the main visual of the 3.1 billion year-long bar was powerful enough to stand on its own. For example one of the additional charts  I was planning was a pie chart of the proportion of reused passwords. This turned out to be both difficult to estimate (since passwords are by nature intended to be secret) and not a particularly convincing argument as to why you should use a passphrase instead, so I cut it from the final version. 

Instead, I decided to go with an infographic to explain what password forms are doing behind the scenes. I would've liked another one to explain password managers, but I couldn't complete it in time. Maybe I'll add it later.
