# User research protocol

I did not interview anyone for Part 2 particularly formally — I didn't have enough completed soon enough to do so. I'll provide a summary of the in-class critique I received.

## In-class critique results
At this stage, I only had one chart created — a basic bar chart version of the general password strength data. It was measured in entropy, rather than estimated time.

### Interviewed:
Three Heinz students in Telling Stories with Data. None were from a web development background.

### General Takeaways

* Is there missing data with the top bars? I can't see anything there.
* The unit of strength is pretty abstract and hard to understand.
* You know that Wealth to Scale website? That might work better for showing the scale of the bottom data point.

Two days later, I had started reworking the bar chart into that style of website. I received the following feedback then:

* Still can't see anything with the top bars
* There's nothing when I scroll (note: it was not finished)
* The fact I can scroll both down to the bottom bar and right to see more of the bar is confusing. They should be side by side instead.
* Where is the title page?

### Changes made in response to this

* Made a hard pivot from a Shorthand website to a pure-HTML, horizontal scrolling experience resembling [If the Moon Were Only One Pixel](https://www.joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html) or [Wealth, shown to scale](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/).
 * This set me back somewhat in terms of progress and is why a more elaborate interview could not be conducted in time.
* Original bar chart converted into a series of progressively longer sequential bars. Since the vast majority of the bars were comically short in comparison to the final bar, I don't think this change will make a huge difference in comparing strength between password types.
* Added some storytelling text to go along with the data points. More charts will follow.


## Future interview plans

### Target Audience
Two groups in particular:

* General website users — the kinds of people making and using passwords
* Web application developers — the kinds of people making things you need passwords for. If possible, I'd like to focus on hobbyists, as professional developers are more likely to have 

### Finding representatives

General website users are easy — that's most people. Ideally I'd like people from a wide variety of ages, and technology/cybersecurity knowledge. I happen to know people I can talk to so I can just ask.

Web application developers are a bit trickier, but I happen to be in the community for a few web applications in particular, so I can ask there. Several of my former co-workers and college friends are also web application devs, though they lean more professional.

### Script

1. Please take a look at this website. Whenever a thought pops into your head, please say it out loud.
2. What do you think this website is trying to tell you?
3. What parts of this website do you think are effective?
4. Is there anything you find confusing here?
5.
